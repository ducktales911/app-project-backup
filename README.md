# app-project
A timed todo list with gamification elements for iOS

[visual sketch]
-of what the final product will look like for the user
-multiple screens
-Clearly specify the possible user interactions
-include concrete examples of data
(Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!)

[main features]
-brief list
-All features should also be visible in the sketch
(If you have complicated features, it might be good to create a separate sketch for each feature.)
-Mark which features define the minimum viable product (MVP) and which parts may be optional to implement.

[Prerequisites]

Describe the things that you’ll have to get in order before really starting your project.

-List the data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources can be found.

-List the external components (libraries like d3-tip or SQLite) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not standard, include a link to its website.

-Include a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?

-Identify the hardest parts of implementing your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.

[Sanity check]

- Before continuing, compare your solution to the project requirements one last time. Also, is it still clear that your proposed project is indeed a solution to the stated problem?

- Also, the proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

- Finally, make sure that your document is spell-checked, and that images are not too large or too small (your document will be read in a normal browser via GitHub).

[Submitting]

- After you have pushed all changes to Github, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be in this format: https://github.com/username/project.

- Don’t commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the README.md, a doc folder (exactly that name), pictures in the doc folder, and nothing else.

[What’s next]

- The next step in your project is creating a design document. There, you’ll describe how your project will be created according to the rules of the application framework that you’re using.

- Meanwhile, keep an eye on the GitHub Issues for your project. This is where you will get feedback on whether your project is accepted as it is described, or you need to make some changes.
